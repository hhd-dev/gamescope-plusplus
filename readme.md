# Gamescope Plus Plus
An up to date version of gamescope, patched with the latest ChimeraOS patch
series, and the Bazzite patch series, while including the reshade repos.

Versus the official gamescope package, it fixes the Unified Refresh Rate
slider on the go, adds the `--force-panel-type external` option, touch gestures
that open the steam menu and QAM, and a 720p patch for 1080p panels such as
the Ally's.

Install instructions:
```bash
